###Disable Caps Lock
I’ve never really liked, or used, the Caps Lock key on my keyboard. I got annoyed when i hit it by mistake, and i therefore often tore the key off my keyboard. But lately i’ve found a few better solutions for the key, thanks to AutoHotkey, a free, open-source utility for Windows.

Adding this code to the .ahk file simply turns the Caps Lock key off, always!
